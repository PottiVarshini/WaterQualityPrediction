# ðŸ’§ Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the concentration levels of key water pollutants (like Oâ‚‚, NOâ‚ƒ, NOâ‚‚, SOâ‚„, POâ‚„, and Cl) based on the **Year** and **Station ID** using a trained **Random Forest Regressor** model.

##  Problem Statement

Monitoring water quality across various locations is critical for environmental sustainability. However, manual sampling is resource-intensive. This project provides a data-driven way to predict water pollutant levels, helping in early intervention and planning.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Understand the working of the **Random Forest Regressor**
- Train a model to predict pollutant levels from basic inputs
- Evaluate model performance using **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- Build a Streamlit UI to make predictions user-friendly

---

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** â€” Data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** â€” Model training
- **Joblib** â€” Model serialization
- **Git & GitHub** â€” Version control
- **Streamlit** â€” Web-based interactive UI
- **Git LFS** â€” Handling large `.pkl` files (>25MB)
